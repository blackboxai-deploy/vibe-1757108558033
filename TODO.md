# üèéÔ∏è 3D Car Racing Game - Implementation Progress

## Phase 1: Environment Setup
- [ ] Install Three.js and related dependencies
- [ ] Configure build system for 3D libraries
- [ ] Set up TypeScript types for Three.js

## Phase 2: Core 3D Engine
- [ ] Create basic Three.js scene with WebGL renderer
- [ ] Implement camera system (third-person follow camera)
- [ ] Add dynamic lighting and shadows
- [ ] Set up post-processing effects

## Phase 3: Car Implementation
- [ ] Build 3D car model with realistic proportions
- [ ] Implement car physics engine
- [ ] Add smooth steering and acceleration controls
- [ ] Create responsive control system (keyboard + touch)

## Phase 4: Obstacle System
- [ ] Develop obstacle generation manager
- [ ] Implement various obstacle types (static, moving, narrow passages)
- [ ] Add precise 3D collision detection
- [ ] Create progressive difficulty scaling

## Phase 5: Game Mechanics
- [ ] Build scoring system with distance and precision bonuses
- [ ] Implement lives/health system
- [ ] Add speed management mechanics
- [ ] Create combo system for consecutive navigations

## Phase 6: User Interface
- [ ] Design professional main menu
- [ ] Create real-time HUD (score, speed, health)
- [ ] Build game over screen with results
- [ ] Add settings panel for customization

## Phase 7: Audio & Effects
- [ ] Integrate engine sound effects
- [ ] Add collision and ambient audio
- [ ] Implement particle effects for crashes
- [ ] Create smooth audio transitions

## Phase 8: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement object pooling for obstacles
- [ ] Add level-of-detail (LOD) system
- [ ] Optimize for 60fps performance
- [ ] Memory management and cleanup

## Phase 9: Mobile & Responsive Design
- [ ] Add touch controls for mobile devices
- [ ] Optimize UI for different screen sizes
- [ ] Test performance on mobile browsers
- [ ] Ensure cross-browser compatibility

## Phase 10: Testing & Polish
- [ ] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) ‚Üí AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing
- [ ] Comprehensive API testing with curl
- [ ] Cross-browser testing and bug fixes
- [ ] Performance profiling and optimization
- [ ] Final visual polish and refinements
- [ ] User experience testing and improvements

## Current Status: Ready to Begin Implementation
Next Step: Install dependencies and set up 3D environment
